          options: [
            { text: "This is normal for their age", feedback: "By age 9, most children have the POTENTIAL for mature catching if they've had practice. This suggests a learning gap, not a developmental timeline issue." },

This child has the physical maturity for mature-stage catching but missed the practice and instruction window. The good news?

At the transition stage, children need small-sided games that narrow their attention to manageable skill and strategy choices. Full games overwhelm them with too many players, too much space, and too many decisions. Small-sided games = more touches, more learning, more success!", correct: true },

Intermediate learners can perform skills consistently but need practice varying conditions. In games, they must dribble WHILE watching defenders, making decisions, and adapting to movement.
